Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Hemant Thobbi, a software developer with a passion for mathematics, cars, and technology. I hold a degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics from San Jose State University, with minors in Computer Science and Economics.

Autonomous Vehicles Enthusiast: A huge car nerd, I’ve taught myself to rebuild engines and boost performance. I’m also self-learning computer vision techniques to recognize roads, lane lines, and objects using dashcam footage. I am actively seeking opportunities in the Autonomous Vehicle industry to further explore this passion.

Software Projects: I have a deep interest in various software ventures and numerous product ideas I’m eager to bring to life. However, my enthusiasm means I often juggle multiple projects at once!

Quantitative Finance: I apply my mathematics education to investment analysis, developing skills in algorithmic trading and quantitative strategies.

Feel free to explore my projects and contact me at hemantgthobbi@gmail.com for any collaboration or inquiries!
