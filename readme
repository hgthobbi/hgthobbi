Hello!
Welcome to my Github, my name is Hemant Thobbi and I am a software developer at General Motors, I majored in Computational and Applied Mathematics at San Jose State University and have minors in Computer Science and Economics

-I am a huge car nerd and have taught myself how to rebuild engines and boost engine performance, in addition, I have been teaching myself how to get a computer to recognize roads, lane lines and objects using dashcam footage. I would like to further my interest in this field by searching for opportunities in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry
-I am also passionate about various ventures in software and have many product ideas that I want to implement however, I cant seem to focus on one project at a time. XD
-I also like to use my mathematics education in investment applications and have been working on developing quantitative analysis skills for developing algorithmic investment strategies.  

Thank You for visting, feel free to contact me via email at hemantgthobbi@gmail.com
